It is 2019. I am now working in a new company called [mClinica](https://mclinica.com/) - I will post a different story about my journey in this new company.

Since moving this new company I have not been able to do some technical writing. Believe me there's a lot of things that I want to write about. So I'll start my first 2019 post with a few things that I ticked off.

As you've heard Google Domains launched an [early access](https://domains.google/tld/dev/) program for the `.dev` domains. So first, I purchased one myself to point this simple Github page to that domain. 

Second, I have rewritten my blog site and will slowly move to [Gatsby.JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) stack. I just used a [starter pack](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) to move my content.

And third, hopefully I would be able to join in on this half marathon in a few weeks.
