Of all my years working as a software engineer, I seldom touch frontend technology. I don't hate it that much, I just do not like how it moves so much in terms of managing a codebase.

Having said all that I still want to revisit my frontend coding. I chose to cook up my Online CV as a simple project for this personal task. So here it is [https://jhnferraris.github.io/cv](https://jhnferraris.github.io/cv).

The site was built on a basic React.JS, CSS Bootstrap and Chart.js. I know this still has a lot to improve and will continue to check this out and think of ways to improve it not just how it will look but also in terms of the codebase.
