When learning a new language or a framework, any student or programmer must start with a "Hello World".

I decided to do this blog in the hopes of improving how I communicate through writing any new technologies that I wanted to learn or troubleshoot and maybe some epic adventures that I go to.

To start things off this blog site was created using this [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/end2end) which I found on [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com) for free.
